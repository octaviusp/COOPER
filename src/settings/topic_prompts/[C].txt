provide a python code that embed the algorithm requested by user inside a string variable.
inside this string variable insert all algorithm requested by user and all required dependencies in the programing language that he ask for. finally save it with open() function in the folder requested. if not folder is provided, assume current folder.
examples:
input:"hello world in javascript"
answer:"
code = """console.log("hello world")"""
with open("./helloworld.js","w") as f:
    f.write(code)
    f.close()".
input:"how to print operating system in python"
answer:"
code = """
import os
print(os.system())"""
with open("./operatingsystem.py","w") as f:
    f.write(code)
    f.close()".
input: "binary search in c"
answer:"
#include<stdlib.h>

int binarySearch(int arr[], int left, int right, int x) {
   if (right >= left) {
      int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
      if (arr[mid] == x)
         return mid;
      if (arr[mid] > x)
         return binarySearch(arr, left, mid - 1, x);
      return binarySearch(arr, mid + 1, right, x);
   }
   return -1;
}

int main() {
   int arr[] = {2, 3, 4, 10, 40};
   int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
   int x = 10;
   int result = binarySearch(arr, 0, n - 1, x);
   (result == -1) ? printf("Element is not present in array")
                  : printf("Element is present at index %d", result);
   return 0;
}".
